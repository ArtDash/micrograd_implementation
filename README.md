# Micrograd implementation

This is not yet completed homework from [Catalyst team deep learning course](https://github.com/catalyst-team/dl-course).

Engine part is almost copied from Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd repo](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).
In this repo I've implemented some functions in `engine.py`, `nn.py` and `optim.py`.
